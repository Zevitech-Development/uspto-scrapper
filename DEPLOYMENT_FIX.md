# CORS and Environment Configuration Fix

## Issue
The login functionality was failing due to CORS errors and incorrect API URL configuration between the Vercel frontend and Railway backend.

## Root Cause
1. Frontend was pointing to localhost instead of the Railway backend URL
2. Backend CORS configuration was missing the Vercel frontend domain
3. Environment variables were not properly configured for production

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes
1. **Updated `.env.production`** - Set correct Railway backend URL
2. **Updated `.env.local`** - Added comments for clarity

### Backend Changes
1. **Updated `.env`** - Added Vercel frontend domain to CORS_ORIGINS
2. **Set NODE_ENV to production** - For proper production configuration

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Backend to Railway
```bash
# Navigate to server directory
cd server

# Ensure your .env file has the correct CORS_ORIGINS
# CORS_ORIGINS should include: https://uspto-scrapper.vercel.app

# Deploy to Railway (Railway will automatically detect changes)
git add .
git commit -m "Fix CORS configuration for production"
git push
```

### 2. Deploy Frontend to Vercel
```bash
# Navigate to client directory
cd client

# Deploy to Vercel
git add .
git commit -m "Update API URL for production"
git push
```

### 3. Verify Environment Variables

#### On Railway:
- Ensure `CORS_ORIGINS` includes: `https://uspto-scrapper.vercel.app`
- Set `NODE_ENV=production`

#### On Vercel:
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://uspto-tsdr-backend-production.up.railway.app/api`

## Testing
After deployment:
1. Visit your Vercel frontend URL
2. Try to login
3. Check browser network tab for successful API calls
4. Verify no CORS errors in console

## Important Notes
- Make sure the Railway backend URL in Vercel environment matches exactly
- Ensure the Vercel frontend URL in Railway CORS_ORIGINS is correct
- Both deployments need to be completed for the fix to work
